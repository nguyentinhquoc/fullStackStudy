            <strong>Date - Present</strong>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it to 1 page if you
              have less than 8 years of professional work experience. If you have more,
              you might consider using 2 pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include a skill section - it's incredibly important. This step will prove
              highly valuable if the company uses ATS (applicant tracking system).
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job description, submit
              your resume in .pdf format. You can convert this file to .pdf in google
              docs by going to File, select Download, and then .pdf.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending on the duration and
              relevance of the position. Keep sections that are less relevant to the job
              you're applying to short.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your most recent position should have the most bullet points, as long as
              the position is relevant to the one you're applying for.
            </li>
            <li>
              Describe your existing role using the present continuous tense and
              describe past roles using the past simple tense.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="job-title">
            <h3>JOB TITLE | Company - Location</h3>
            <strong>Date - Date</strong>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's not enough to describe what you have done or your areas of
              responsibility; you need to quantify the impact of your work. Recruiters
              scan resumes for numbers, so quantify as much as you can.
            </li>
            <li>You can talk about soft improvement your initiatives yielded.</li>
            <li>
              Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of $$$ that your work
              contributed to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. No recruiter
              will read bullet points that are as long as paragraphs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate any typos.
              Additionally, consider having someone else proofread it to prevent sending
              an imperfect resume.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="job-title">
            <h3>JOB TITLE | Company - Location</h3>
            <strong>Date - Date</strong>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be written in the
              past tense. The exception is if you're describing your current position
              with ongoing responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're a fresh grad with limited work experience you can move the
              education section to the top of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have 5-8 years of work experience, do not include internship
              experience in your resume unless highly relevant.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="job-title">
            <h3>JOB TITLE | Company - Location</h3>

              Congrats! Once you're done filling out the work experience section, the
              hardest part is over. Now, include a few more details about your education
              and skills below and you're ready to submit that application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure to name your resume professionally. Save it under the title
